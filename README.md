# Day_Planner
The hours of the workday are shown, with each hour having an area to type in and save an event. When the screen is refreshed the events remain. The color red means that is the current hour, and the future hours are in green. The past hours are gray. This is a functional day planner so you can store your events and understand what time of the day it is. 


# Screenshot
It is currently 9 am, so 9 am is red, while the future hours are green. The local storage saves the events for each hour even when screen is refreshed.
